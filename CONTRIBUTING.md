## Suggested pending improvements

This is a list of topics that could make it to a future version of Arachne.

### Hardware
- **New module**. Add some kind of add-on such as a clamp; design the electrical circuit and couple it to the software and design of the base model.
- **Camera**. Add vision to the prototype with an available module adapting it to the model.

### Design
- **Improving the design**. Improvements or corrections to the current design. Adding elements that give more rigidity or stability to the current prototype..


### Software
- **Inverse kinematics**. Determining the movement of the legs to automate Arachne's movement.
- **Graphical user interface**. Create a graphical user interface linked to the command line.
- **Mobile application**. Create mobile application that communicates with Arachne via Bluetooth or Wifi.

Obviously, any new ideas or suggestions are welcome!
